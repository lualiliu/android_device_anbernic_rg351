Use buildroot-2021.02.1 with that resizing_defconfig
Make rootfs with buildroot
Cross compile util-linux (specifically fdisk tool) statically using the toolchain created by buildroot
Ex:

Add the buildroot toolchain to path then run 
./configure --verbose --host=aarch64-linux --target=aarch64-linux --disable-shared --without-tinfo --without-ncurses --disable-ipv6 
export CFLAGS=-static
export SUID_CFLAGS=-static
export SUID_LDFLAGS=-static
export CPPFLAGS=-static
export LDFLAGS=-static
make LDFLAGS="--static" -j15 fdisk

Fdisk in prebuilt ramdisk is from util-linux commit 5ec1108c0022a156bf6d796e3d50243bbaff75a5

Replace the fdisk in rootfs with the statically built from source one (the one included in buildroot works differently than the standard fdisk and breaks commands)

Add in the linuxrc from this folder into the rootfs, and make a symlink to it called init (you could also just name it init, but I prefer having it linuxrc)
Add resized and resizing images in ppm format (can be made using GIMP)
Also, download armv8 prebuilt busybox from busybox website so that the command for the splash screens works
